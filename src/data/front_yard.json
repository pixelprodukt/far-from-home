Once, a sorrowful little angel poured water into its basin, but now the edge is overgrown with weeds, and the angel's jug is cracked. Old flowerbeds line the path with sharp-edged underbrush that seems to wind around your ankles with every step. You can also see a narrow path which leads to the side of the house.",
